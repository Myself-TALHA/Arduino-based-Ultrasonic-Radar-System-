# Arduino-based-Ultrasonic-Radar-System-

The project is based on Ultrasonic Radar System which detects any object in its range of vicinity. In this project by using Ultrasonic Sensor, Arduino UNO R3 and Servo Motor we manage to create the prototype cum mini Ultrasonic Radar System. The output and the Radar is visible on Processing application. With the help of Processing application we can also know the exact location and at what distance is the object in. The application further also let us know at what Angle the object is and what distance i.e., cm the target is from our position.
